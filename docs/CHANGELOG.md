# GateVision — Project Change Log

All times use **IST (Asia/Calcutta, UTC+05:30)**. Newest entries come first.

This is a manually maintained log, not an automatic file monitor. Add an entry with every future change: date/time, what changed, affected areas, verification, and commit ID when available. Git timestamps below are author timestamps, not proof of the exact time each file was edited. Earlier history is summarized from the available commits, not reconstructed minute by minute.

## 2026-09-10 15:45 IST — ISO Feet Size Code 'C' to 'G' Correction and UI Page Alignment Overhaul

- **ISO 6346 Size-Type Correction**: OCR models (EasyOCR, Qwen-VL) frequently misread the standard dry freight container type code 'G' as 'C' (e.g. `45C1` instead of `45G1`, `22C1` instead of `22G1`, `42C1` instead of `42G1`). Since ISO 6346 defines no container type 'C', added deterministic pattern correction `correct_feet_size_codes()` in `validator.py` and integrated into OCR reading pipeline.
- **Feet Size Extraction & Validation**: Added `parse_feet_size()` supporting ISO size-type codes (`45G1` -> `40 FT HC`, `42G1` -> `40 FT`, `22G1` -> `20 FT`, `L5G1` -> `45 FT HC`) and direct feet text (`40FT` -> `40 FT`). Marked validated size codes with `VALID_SIZE_CODE` status.
- **API & Database Integration**: Updated `GateRepository.event()` and `events()` to parse and surface `container_size` and `size_code` directly in event payloads.
- **UI Page Alignment & Layout Polish**:
  - Camera card dropdowns (`Camera source`, `Position`, `Gate direction`) given fixed label width guides (`105px`) so all inputs and dropdown arrows align on the identical vertical axis.
  - Standardized event filter row (`CONTAINER NUMBER`, `MOVEMENT`, and `Apply filters` button) to a uniform 36px control height with aligned baselines.
  - Added dedicated `Size / Feet` badge column to Recent Gate Events table (`📏 40 FT HC (45G1)`).
  - Enhanced Event Detail view with container size badge and evidence badges.
- **Verification**: All 13 validator tests passed (`test_feet_size_code_c_to_g_correction`), full backend suite passed, Angular production build succeeded, and browser subagent visually verified alignment across Overview, Events Table, and Detail pages.

## 2026-09-10 15:19 IST — Store OCR images in snapshot folders

- Changed pre-OCR storage from database image blobs to `snapshots/ocr-pending/<evidence-id>/crop.png` and `frame.png`.
- SQLite now stores only paths, metadata, OCR results and job status. Images are saved before the pending job is registered.
- Added startup migration for existing BLOB jobs, preserving IDs, validation, retries and status. Export failures roll back database changes; matching partial exports are reused on retry.
- Completed images remain on disk. Backups/retention must cover both folders and the metadata index; orphan files after interrupted registration are retained.
- Verification: **71 backend tests passed, 1 skipped**, including nine storage tests covering migration, rollback, partial writes, recovery and path containment. One existing test-client deprecation warning remains.
- Timestamp basis: local clock at review start, rounded to the minute. Migration runs on updated application startup; this entry does not claim the running application's data was already migrated.

## 2026-09-10 15:11 IST — Durable save-first OCR

- Added a transactional local SQLite OCR spool containing lossless crop/full-frame images and original camera/role/lane/timestamp metadata before OCR execution.
- Added a separate disk writer, disk-backed pending-job recovery, persisted validation/confirmation votes and retry-safe event completion.
- Allowed interval-selected crops to save independently of OCR speed, bounded by the configured per-track sample limit.
- Preserved historical job identity across source switches and restarts; stopped attaching unrelated current-time companion frames to delayed jobs.
- Added configurable retained-payload capacity (`OCR_SPOOL_MAX_MB`, default 10240 MB), spool counts and error reporting. Existing evidence is not automatically deleted.
- Limits: pre-commit staging remains volatile; queue saturation can drop unsaved samples; shared-GPU contention remains. Pending jobs require models and event database availability to finish.
- Verification: **68 passed, 1 skipped** in the backend suite, including recovery, pixel fidelity, capacity, failed-save retry, OCR retry, confirmation and post-event-commit crash tests. One existing test-client deprecation warning remains. Physical-camera and actual power-cut tests were not performed.
- Timestamp basis: local clock during implementation; uncommitted working-tree changes.

## 2026-09-10 14:50 IST — Latest-frame streaming and YOLO scheduling

- Replaced dashboard MJPEG connections with demand-driven WebSocket JPEG previews (one frame in flight per view); retained older preview endpoints for compatibility.
- Added origin validation, reconnect/cleanup behavior and development-proxy WebSocket support. Added and installed `websockets` 15.0.1 within the declared dependency range.
- CPU OCR no longer holds the YOLO accelerator lock. Scheduler leaves the latest frame pending while GPU OCR is busy, instead of processing a frame selected before the wait.
- New preview overlays use only the latest source-matched detection result with a 300 ms age limit, including empty results to clear old boxes.
- Removed buffer size from mandatory FFmpeg open parameters; retained best-effort post-open tuning.
- Documented that OCR reads in-memory crops **before** event snapshots are saved; GPU OCR can still block YOLO on a shared accelerator.
- Verification: full regression run 60 passed, 1 skipped; Angular build passed. All three targeted live-preview tests then passed, including eight simultaneous test connections with health still accessible. No physical-camera latency or throughput benchmark was possible.
- Timestamp basis: local clock during implementation, rounded to the minute; uncommitted changes.

## 2026-09-10 14:10 IST — Project documentation refresh

- Updated `brain.md` throughout to match eight views, MJPEG streaming, automatic ONVIF discovery, source preservation, saved operator roles, current APIs and configuration.
- Clarified that site/admin/cloud labels are static UI text, not authentication or delivery evidence.
- Clarified that the Prosper dispatcher is memory-only, not a durable outbox.
- Added this change log and linked it from the project brain.
- Scope: documentation only. Existing application changes were preserved.
- Verification: compared documentation with current source and Git history; checked Markdown changes for whitespace errors. Application tests were not rerun for this documentation-only update.
- Timestamp basis: local clock at the start of this documentation review, rounded to the minute. Status: uncommitted working-tree changes.

## 2026-09-10 — Automatic camera discovery and operator assignment

Exact edit start/end times were not recorded. Final frontend build completed at **14:02:01 IST** (tool timestamp `2026-09-10T08:32:01.939Z`); this is a build time, not a commit time.

- Added background ONVIF discovery at application startup and periodic retry (default: 60 seconds after a scan completes).
- Added ONVIF Media1 profile/RTSP URI negotiation using optional shared camera credentials, bounded discovery and same-host endpoint checks.
- Added discovered sources to camera dropdowns and automatically filled unused enabled views without overwriting saved source choices, configured RTSP inputs or active uploaded videos.
- Added saved position and IN/OUT/Unknown controls. Newly auto-assigned views remain Unassigned/Unknown until the operator chooses their role.
- Added discovery status, Search again, and camera setup warnings to the dashboard.
- Fixed MJPEG preview to follow the current worker after switching sources.
- Added configuration examples, role persistence and discovery tests.
- Main areas: `backend/app/camera/discovery.py`, `backend/app/runtime.py`, camera APIs/settings, Angular camera controls and backend tests.
- Verification: **58 tests passed, 1 skipped**; Angular production build passed. One existing test-client deprecation warning remained. Local ONVIF scan returned **0 cameras**, so live hardware behavior was not verified.
- Status at log creation: uncommitted working-tree changes; no commit ID yet.

- Added the one-command `start.ps1` startup path and retired legacy application files in this commit.
